# mushrooms
## Data 
Images were scraped from google with the script, ``mushroom_scraper.py``. This script took a csv file of the scientific name of a set of mushrooms and downloaded the visible images on google. This script could be modified to download other types of images. 

The images themselves are grouped into four categories: edible, conditionally edible, poisonous, and deadly. Within each category, a set of mushroom species are listed as folders. Each folder contains a set of images of the mushroom gathered by the script. The images have been manually filtered for relevancy
